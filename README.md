# The Event Stream
A digital add stack (InMobi) provides a stream of events (see: [`data/ad_events.parquet`](./data/ad_events.parquet)).

Each event consists of the following columns:

- `event_time`
- `app_id` (ID of app associated with the event)
    > Foreign key from [`data/apps.csv`](./data/apps.csv)
- `geo_device_id` (ID of device associated with the event)
    > Foreign key from [`data/geo_device.csv`](./data/geo_device.csv)
- `advertiser_id` (ID of the advertiser associated with the event)
    > Foreign key from [`data/advertisers.csv`](./data/advertisers.csv)
- `ad_format`:
  - `native`
  - `video`
  - `banner`
  - `interstitial`
  - `rewarded`
- `is_filled` (indicator for whether ad request is filled)
- `is_impression` (indicator for whether ad is rendered)
- `is_click` (indicator for whether ad is clicked on)
- `revenue` (revenue received by InMobi as per some cost model)

> **NOTE**: The dataset [`data/ad_events.parquet`](./data/ad_events.parquet) is a synthetic ad-events dataset capturing ~9 million events over 5 weeks, along with dimensions: impressions, requests, fills, clicks, and revenue events across dimensions (app, device, OS, geo, advertiser, ad format), with realistic seasonality and noise.

# The Metrics Stream
Key metrics must be calculated from the event stream and monitored for deviations/anomalies. [`docs/metrics_glossary.md`](./docs/metrics_glossary.md) provides an overview about the metrics used and how they are calculated. The columns `is_filled`, `is_impression`, `is_click`, and `revenue` in the event stream serve as the raw data from which metrics are calculated.

# Alerting - Prerequisite, Not Problem Statement
We must set up alerts per metric, based on:

- Defined threshold values
- Calculated running averages
- Calculated deviations

> **NOTE**: This is an in-development list, not a definitive.

The key problem statement:

- Not **what** has deviated/changed enough to notice/investigate
- But the actual investigation itself

# Problem Statement
> **Reference**: [`InMobi/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`, **github.com**](https://github.com/sidagarwal04/click-a-thon-2026/blob/main/InMobi/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md)

- Auto-investigation of why a metric moved
    > The definition of "moved" may be threshold-based.
- Returns a short, evidence-backed explanation in seconds, not days <br> =>
  - Clear breakdown of [metric dimensions](#metric-dimensions) (part of "evidence-backed")
  - Reasoning from the above breakdown (part of "evidence-backed")
  - Low latency ("seconds, not days")

Essentially, this is automatic root-cause analysis for real-time metric deviations.

**Bonus**:

- State what metric dimensions were checked
- State what metric dimensions were ruled out

# Key Concepts
## Metric Dimensions
Here, we interpret the term "metric dimension" as one of two things:

- A qualitative categorization/filtering of the metric
    > E.g.: Categorizing "fill rate" into "fill rate per app".
- A metric contributing to the metric's value
    > E.g.: CTR is calculated from clicks and impressions.
 
Metric dimensions serve as the basis for root-cause analysis.

## Advertisement Cost Models
- Cost per Mille (CPM)
- Cost per Click (CPC)
- Cost per Installation (CPI)

The cost model determines how `revenue` is calculated as per:

- `is_impression`
- `is_click`
